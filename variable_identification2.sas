* Import and sort table icustays in two ways;

*Do this in two ways. One way, sort the ICUSTAYS table by SUBJECT_ID and then by the ICUSTAY_ID, 
and then keep only the first instance for each SUBJECT_ID. This works if the IDs are increasing 
with each stay. But, what if they donâ€™t work that way? Maybe they changed the system for the IDs?;

PROC IMPORT datafile = '/folders/myfolders/icustays_kidney.csv' OUT = work.icustays DBMS = CSV;
RUN;

PROC SORT DATA=work.icustays OUT = work.icu;
BY SUBJECT_ID ICUSTAY_ID;
RUN;

PROC SORT DATA=work.icu OUT = nodupout NODUPKEY;
BY SUBJECT_ID;
RUN;

*NOTE: There were 378 observations read from the data set WORK.ICU.
 NOTE: 39 observations with duplicate key values were deleted.
 NOTE: The data set WORK.NODUPOUT has 339 observations and 12 variables.;

* 2nd way;
* Import table patients;
PROC IMPORT datafile = '/folders/myfolders/patients.csv' OUT = work.patients DBMS = CSV;
RUN;

* Import table admissions;
PROC IMPORT datafile = '/folders/myfolders/admissions_kidney.csv'
OUT = work.admis 
DBMS = CSV
replace;
RUN;

* A longer way that will provide more surety, is the following:
Merge data from the PATIENTS table and the ADMISSIONS table (hospital admissions) linked by the
HADM_ID to get the hospital stay variables. Then merge in the data from the ICUSTAYS table, linked by
the variable (ICUSTAY_ID). Doing this, you can get the day/time admitted to the hospital and ICU. Then
you can sort by SUBJECT_ID and then the admitting day/time to the hospital, and then the admitting
time for the ICU. Keep only the first ICU stay. ;
