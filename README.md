Data cleaning work done on MIMIC-III data using SAS

Data were obtained from MIMIC-III database. MIMIC-III is a relational database containing tables of data relating to patients who stayed within the intensive care units at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It has been de-identified and publically available; the dates such as the date of birth and date of admission are relative rather than exact for patient privacy protection purpose. The database comprises over 58,000 hospital admissions for 38,645 adults and 7,875 neonates. The data spans June 2001 - October 2012. MIMIC consists of multiple related tables for patients such as Chartevents, Labevents, Items, Labitems, Patients, Icustays, Admissions, etc. Item-id’s are unique for items that are included in different tables, and they connect between Chartevents/Labevents and other tables in replacement of the variable names and descriptions altogether. Item-id’s for BUN category were found in Labevents and Labitems, not in Chartevents and Items. The outcomes dialysis and ventilator were defined by multiple variables while hospital mortality was defined by a column hospital_expire_flag in the admission table, not the general expire_flag column in the patient table so we can exclusively make use of in-hospital mortality. Patients’ age older than 89 is recorded as 300 in the database, and it is replaced with the median age of those patients which is 91.4 in our study dataset.
